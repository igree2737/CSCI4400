  Work on the functional and non-functional requirements of your project. You are expected to elicit at least 
ten functional requirements and two non-functional requirements. Update the requirements.doc file in your 
github project repository 

Functional:
1.Program should be able to reliably measure and record blood sugar levels.
   -Before eating and after eating.
2.Program should reliably deliver the correct amount of insulin to counteract blood sugar levels.
   -Insulin delivered either before or after eating, not both.
   -May be a limit on how much insulin a patient can take per day.
3.Program should be able to deliver insulin at any time it is needed.
4.Program should be designed with the safety of the patient as the priority.
5.Calculations for amount of insulin injected must be accurate.
   -Based on the rate of change of blood sugar levels.
6.
7.
8.
9.
10.

Non-Functional:
1.Programming must be done in Java.
2.Because of the nature of the project, the program should be extremely robust and secure.
   -Cannot be tampered with or altered easily.
   -If the program should encounter a problem, it must be handled in a way such that the safety of the patient is assured.
