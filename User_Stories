As a diabetic, I want emergency services to be contacted if I should collapse from low blood sugar.
As a Doctor, I want my patient's insulin dosage and use to be recorded so that I can monitor and make sure they are getting the correct dosage when they need it.
As a Paramedic, I want to be able to quickly check a person's last known blood sugar level so that I can administer insulin immediately if they need it.
As a diabetic, I want to be alerted if my blood sugar is too high or too low so that I can act accordingly.
